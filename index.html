   Hi there!  I finally completed a working version of my first official Android app, named <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bignerdranch.android.abcsforkids">ABCs Drag and Drop</a> which is now on the Google Play Store, feel free to download it.  There's a ton of work to be done to it, but the going through the entire process was the best learning experience ever.

  <b>5-27-17:</b><br/>
   Welcome back!  I haven't been updating the site daily, but I have been working on my kid's ABC application.  It's coming along great, I would say that it is at least 80% complete.  I need to work on the details of the UI and make the overall feel more pristine.  I'm uploading the project in progress under: <br/>
   "ABC Kids App" posted under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.

   Hi everyone!  I did not get a chance to work on projects over the weekend, but I was able to read the major of chapter 14 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)."  It covers persistent data storage by using SQLite.  I decided that I'm going to take a quick break from the book to design a basic app to deploy on the Google Play Store for my portfolio.  I have'nt finalized the name, but it's going to be a kids app focused on dragging and dropping letters from the alphabet on to an ImageView.  I'm uploading the project in progress under: <br/>
   "ABC Kids App" posted under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.

  <b>5-18-17:</b><br/>
   Finished Chapter 13 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)."  Today I was able to work with ActionBar.  CriminalIntent now has an "Add (+)" crime button and has an Up button after looking at the details of the crime.<br/>
   CriminalIntent project has been updated and posted under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.
  <hr> 
  
  <b>5-17-17:</b><br/>
   Finished Chapter 12 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)."  Today I was able to cover:
   <ul>
   	<li>Create the DatePickerFragment class for CriminalIntent</li>
   	<li>AlertDialog</li>
   	<li>Extra</li>
   	<li>Intent</li>
   </ul>
   CriminalIntent project has been updated and posted under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.

  <b>5-16-17:</b><br/>
   Finished Chapter 11 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)."  This chapter covered the ViewPager class which is similiar to RecyclerView, but much easier to implement.  Now users are able to navigate the app by swiping left or right when viewing the details from an item tapped in the main RecyclerView.

   Took a small break from coding to respond to employment opportunities.  I was able to finish reading Chapter 10 and I'll be posting the update to CriminalIntent soon.<br/>
   Finished Chapter 10, in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)".  The topics covered were:<br/>
   <ul>
   	<li>Intent</li>
   	<li>Extra</li>
   	<li>Bundle</li>
   	<li>Bundle Arguments</li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   CriminalIntent project has been updated and posted under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.

  <b>5-11-17:</b><br/>
   I was able to finish Chapter 9 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)", which covers really simple stuff:<br/>
   <ul>
    	<li>ConstraintLayout</li>
    	<li>Best ways to size and display text (px, dp, sp)</li>
   	    <li>Margins Vs. Padding</li>
   	    <li>Styles introduction</li>	
    </ul>  
    
    I also covered about a quarter of Chapter 10.  Chapter 10 covers seguing from a Fragment that holds a RecyclerView to a different Activity with details about the item that was clicked in the RecyclerView using Intents and Extras.  Tough concepts, but fortunately, I understand what is happening.  I may continue more today, if not i'll push for tomorrow.  The CriminalIntent project has been updated under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.   
  <hr>  
  
  <b>5-10-17:</b><br/>
   Today, I was able to finished a practice project using a Fragment Manager and RecyclerView.  I will start Chapter 9 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)" tomorrow.  The new project can be found under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section. 
  <hr>    
  
  <b>5-9-17:</b><br/>
   Re-read Chapter 8 and started a new practice project on Fragment Manager and RecyclerView.  I will post the project tomorrow.
  <hr> 
  
  <b>5-8-17:</b><br/>
   Chapter 8 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)" is an intense Chapter that covers a ton of new concepts for me including:
    <ul>
    	<li>Singleton</li>
    	<li>RecyclerView</li>
   	    <li>ViewHolder</li>
   	   <li>Adapter</li>    	    	
    </ul><br/>
    I think I'm going to re-read this Chapter tomorrow because there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to making RecyclerViews work.  I must admit that iOS makes ListViews MUCH simpler than RecyclerViews.  If you'd like to see the updated code for the project: Criminal Intent, it us updated under my GitHub profile at the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section. 
  <hr>   
  
  <b>5-7-17:</b><br/>
    I finished Chapter 6 and 7 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)".  Chapter 6 covered the many variations of Android API's.  For Geoquiz, our minimum target is API 19 KITKAT.  I added the final touches to Geoquiz which animate's the CheatActivity's mShowAnserButton to disappear after it's pressed.  <br/>
    Chapter 7 focuses on another topic that I'm familiar with: Fragments.  I spent alot of time in this Chapter to really grasp the concepts of Fragments and learned a few things.  This chapter also started a new Project named "Criminal Intent".  It will take 13 Chapters to complete this project, but I'm so ready to learn!
    I've uploaded the final implementation of Geoquiz and Criminal Intent under my GitHub profile, which you can find under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section. <br/>
  <hr>  
           
  <b>5-6-17:</b><br/>
    I was able to complete Chapter 5 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)".  I feel like I have a really good understanding of the major concepts this Chapter is covering.  The major topics learned in Chapter 5 include:<br/>
    <ul>
    	<li>Intent</li>
    	<li>Debugging (break points and more)</li>
    	<li>startActivity</li>
    	<li>startActivityForResult</li>
    </ul>
    I've uploaded the updated Geoquiz Project under my GitHub profile, which you can find under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.  I may complete some of Chapter 6 today, if not tomorrow.

  Major. major, major changes to this website.  It was almost an overhaul to the original framework.  I finally got a chance to understand Bootstrap3's grid system.  Originally, I was only relying on Bootstrap3's extra small *(XS)  columns without a good understanding of what that meant.  But now, I implemented all four: XS, SM, MD, LG column-types in order to make ALL viewports friendly for viewing my site.<br/>
  On top of that, I was able to complete Chapter 4 and about 90% of Chapter 5 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)".  I could have completely finished Chapter 5, but I didn't want to skim the Chapter.  Chapter 5 covers so many fundamental concepts when working with Intents and Activities, so I really want to dig deep and understand what is going on.  I won't upload a project today, but after my brain stops hurting and I get some rest, I'll post the final implementation of the Geoquiz project tomorrow.

  <b>5-4-17:</b><br/>
  Today, I was able to finish Chapter 3 in the book: "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)".  This chapter gave a high-level view of an application's life cycle:<br/>
   - Nonexistent <br/>
   - Stopped (in memory) <br/>
   - Paused (visible) <br/>
   - Resumed (active in foreground).<br/>
     Another thing that was taught was basic usage of logging.  On today's project, I did overrides on Geoquiz's life cycle and added log debug coding on each overridden method.  The updates can be found under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.

  <b>5-3-17:</b><br/>
  So for today's learning adventure, I finished Chapter 2 in the book: Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 3/e (Big Nerd Ranch Guides)."  For today's "A Project a Day", I'm continuing and building on yesterday's project under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.  Today's continuation project explained many concepts that I'm already familiar with, but also taught me "proper etiquette" when using resources in my project. <br /> 
  <b>Summary of today's project:</b><br/>
  - Added Array of additional questions <br/>
  - Added logic to True and False questions <br/>
  - Added next button logic to cycle through Array of questions <br/>
  - Implemented image to button (learned about Android's image auto-scaling capabilities) <br/>

  It's tough to master coding without specializing in something you enjoy doing.  I've always had a place in my heart for developing mobile applications.  I first learned about mobile app. development in school after taking a class in "Mobile App. Development" particularly in iOS Swift.  After that semester was over, I started working on my own projects in Android Studio.  So for now, I'm going to focus on Android Studio and learn some new concepts.  For today's "A Project a Day", I'm posting a new project under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.  It's a basic Android app with a true and false button that displays a toast if you press it.

  Graduation day!  No projects today.

  <b>4-30-17:</b><br/>
  I really needed to prioritize the way this website is showing in mobile.  I made a ton of changes to make my website more responsive to different displays.  Some of the changes included changing font sizes to use vw (view height) versus px.  I still may change this aspect and substitute it with @media tags.  The only changes were done to the main index.html.  Once I'm satsified with it, then I'll apply similar changes to other pages.  I actually walk tomorrow, in regards to graduation, so I may not be able to do much.  We'll see!

  <b>4-29-17:</b><br/>
  I just completed 3 final exams yesterday (4-28-17), so as you can imagine, I wasn't able to work on anything new.  I thought about taking today off, but my conscience got the best of me and I started something new today.  To really challenge myself, I googled "Java problems practice" and ran across <a href="http://www.CodingBat.com">CodingBat.com</a>.  I've been to this site several times throughout schooling at FIU, but I've never had the time to really sit down and practice.  The website provides some awesome brain teasers for practicing Java problems.  I've completed a few of the warmup exercises today and will be posting what I've done so far under my <a href="Java Projects.html">Java Projects</a> page.  Fun stuff so far!
  <hr>
  
  <b>4-27-17:</b><br/>
  School finals are here :( , which means that I won't be able to work on any projects today.  I graduate with my B.S. in Information Technoloy from FIU on Monday 5/1!  I'm guessing that I can start more projects on Sunday 4-30.  Wish me luck!

  <b>4-26-17:</b><br/>
  Today I was able to complete three more exercises for the TreeMap project.  I ran into trouble with another fuzzy area (Comparator/Comparable interfaces Step 7).  I've learned that comparator interfaces are great when creating a standalone class that strictly compares two objects.  Instead I implemented the Comparable interface, which inclusively compares another object against itself.  I've uploaded the project to <a href="Java Projects.html">Java Projects</a>.  The github link will obviously be the same as yesterday.

  <b>4-25-17:</b><br/>
  After watching a YouTube video that was shared with me about breaking into the "Big Four" companies of technology, I was inspired to focus on all data structures. Instead of focusing on 2-d Arrays, I'm re-learning something I've been exposed to only once (TreeMaps).  To get a better understanding of what TreeMaps are, I'm going to answer 13 questions.  I was only able to answer four of them today, but I'll continue to answer the rest tomorrow (hopefully)!  I've uploaded the project under Java Projects. 
  <hr>
 
  <b>4-24-17:</b><br/>
  I've decided that I am going to commit myself to creating at least one project per day (or at least try my best!).  For the first few days, I'll be doing refresher projects in Java, then move on to unfamiliar concepts in either Java or Android Studio. <br>
  For today's project, I've created a basic Java application that sorts two types of arrays (String[] and int[]).  Lately I've been working in Android Studio, so opening up Netbeans was sort of like riding a bike.  Tommorow I'll attempt to work with two-dimensional arrays as another refresher.
