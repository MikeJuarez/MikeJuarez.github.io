Welcome to my website (built from ground up with HTML5, Bootstrap3 and custom CSS files) which contains a portfolio of applications that I've developed using multiple programming languages.  I am a junior software developer graduating from Florida International University on May 1st of 2017 with a 
		   Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am an experienced and accomplished sales associate with over ten years' experience at <a href="www.att.com">AT&amp;T.</a> While working on team-based projects at AT&amp;T, I have developed a passion for coding and decided to further my education with a focus on software development.  To help transition my new-found passion into a dream career, I am seeking internship or an entry-level position in a software development role that will effectively maximize my experience from working in a fast-paced sales environment.  If you are looking for a self-motivated, hard-working associate developer in Java, C#, iOS, Android Studio (Java), HTML5, CSS and more, please reach out to me at your best convenience!<br>

  School finals are here :( , which means that I won't be able to work on any projects today.  I graduate with my B.S. in Information Technoloy from FIU on Monday 5/1!  I'm guessing that I can start more projects on Sunday 4-30.  Wish me luck!

  Today I was able to complete three more exercises for the TreeMap project.  I ran into trouble with another fuzzy area (Comparator/Comparable interfaces Step 7).  I've learned that comparator interfaces are great when creating a standalone class that strictly compares two objects.  Instead I implemented the Comparable interface, which inclusively compares another object against itself.  I've uploaded the project to <a href="Java Projects.html">Java Projects</a>.  The github link will obviously be the same as yesterday.

  After watching a YouTube video that was shared with me about breaking into the "Big Four" companies of technology, I was inspired to focus on all data structures. Instead of focusing on 2-d Arrays, I'm re-learning something I've been exposed to only once (TreeMaps).  To get a better understanding of what TreeMaps are, I'm going to answer 13 questions.  I was only able to answer four of them today, but I'll continue to answer the rest tommorrow (hopefully)!  I've uploaded the project under Java Projects.

  I've decided that I am going to commit myself to creating at least one project per day (or at least try my best!).  For the first few days, I'll be doing refresher projects in Java, then move on to unfamiliar concepts in either Java or Android Studio. <br>
  For today's project, I've created a basic Java application that sorts two types of arrays (String[] and int[]).  Lately I've been working in Android Studio, so opening up Netbeans was sort of like riding a bike.  Tommorow I'll attempt to work with two-dimensional arrays as another refresher.
