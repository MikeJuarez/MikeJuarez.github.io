		   Hi there!  Welcome to my website (built from ground up with HTML5, Bootstrap3 and custom CSS files) which contains a portfolio of applications that I've developed using multiple programming languages.  I am a junior software developer graduating from Florida International University on May 1st of 2017 with a 
		   Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am an experienced and accomplished sales associate with over ten years' experience at <a href="www.att.com">AT&amp;T.</a> While working on team-based projects at AT&amp;T, I have developed a passion for coding and decided to further my education with a focus on software development.  To help transition my new-found passion into a dream career, I am seeking internship or an entry-level position in a software development role that will effectively maximize my experience from working in a fast-paced sales environment.  If you are looking for a self-motivated, hard-working associate developer in Java, C#, iOS, Android Studio (Java), HTML5, CSS and more, please reach out to me at your best convenience!

  It's tough to master coding without specializing in something you enjoy doing.  I've always had a place in my heart for developing mobile applications.  I first learned about mobile app. development in school after taking a class in "Mobile App. Development" particularly in iOS Swift.  After that semester was over, I started working on my own projects in Android Studio.  So for now, I'm going to focus on Android Studio and learn some new concepts.  For today's "A Project a Day", I'm posting a new project under the <a href="Android Projects">Android Projects</a> section.  It's a basic Android app with a true and false button that displays a toast if you press it.

  Graduation day!  No projects today.

  I really needed to prioritize the way this website is showing in mobile.  I made a ton of changes to make my website more responsive to different displays.  Some of the changes included changing font sizes to use vw (view height) versus px.  I still may change this aspect and substitute it with @media tags.  The only changes were done to the main index.html.  Once I'm satsified with it, then I'll apply similar changes to other pages.  I actually walk tommorrow, in regards to graduation, so I may not be able to do much.  We'll see!

  I just completed 3 final exams yesterday (4-28-17), so as you can imagine, I wasn't able to work on anything new.  I thought about taking today off, but my conscience got the best of me and I started something new today.  To really challenge myself, I googled "Java problems practice" and ran across <a href="http://www.CodingBat.com">CodingBat.com</a>.  I've been to this site several times throughout schooling at FIU, but I've never had the time to really sit down and practice.  The website provides some awesome brain teasers for practicing Java problems.  I've completed a few of the warmup exercises today and will be posting what I've done so far under my <a href="Java Projects.html">Java Projects</a> page.  Fun stuff so far!

  <b>4-27-17:</b><br/>
  School finals are here :( , which means that I won't be able to work on any projects today.  I graduate with my B.S. in Information Technoloy from FIU on Monday 5/1!  I'm guessing that I can start more projects on Sunday 4-30.  Wish me luck!

  Today I was able to complete three more exercises for the TreeMap project.  I ran into trouble with another fuzzy area (Comparator/Comparable interfaces Step 7).  I've learned that comparator interfaces are great when creating a standalone class that strictly compares two objects.  Instead I implemented the Comparable interface, which inclusively compares another object against itself.  I've uploaded the project to <a href="Java Projects.html">Java Projects</a>.  The github link will obviously be the same as yesterday.

  After watching a YouTube video that was shared with me about breaking into the "Big Four" companies of technology, I was inspired to focus on all data structures. Instead of focusing on 2-d Arrays, I'm re-learning something I've been exposed to only once (TreeMaps).  To get a better understanding of what TreeMaps are, I'm going to answer 13 questions.  I was only able to answer four of them today, but I'll continue to answer the rest tommorrow (hopefully)!  I've uploaded the project under Java Projects.

  <b>4-24-17:</b><br/>
  I've decided that I am going to commit myself to creating at least one project per day (or at least try my best!).  For the first few days, I'll be doing refresher projects in Java, then move on to unfamiliar concepts in either Java or Android Studio. <br>
  For today's project, I've created a basic Java application that sorts two types of arrays (String[] and int[]).  Lately I've been working in Android Studio, so opening up Netbeans was sort of like riding a bike.  Tommorow I'll attempt to work with two-dimensional arrays as another refresher.
